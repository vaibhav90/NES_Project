Intended platforms: Tmote Sky, Sentilla JCreate (and others with CC2420).

Tested platforms: Tmote Sky and Sentilla JCreate


Description:
 Some simple examples on how to use the CC2420 radio special test modes to create interference.

interference_example_1: Periodic interference
interference_example_2: Continuous interference with random power
interference_example_3: Continuous interference with predefined power value
interference_example_4: Incremental interference
interference_example_5: Accurate timing
interference_example_6: Continuous interference shape like  ____--_-----_--____
interference_example_7: Interference triggered by Tmote/TelosB user button
