Long description: 
A pair of sensor nodes (sensys_tx and sensys_rx) are communicating on channel CHANNEL_SENDER (default is 24).
The statistics of the communication (SNR, LQI, PRR) are sent to a base station (sensys_base) using a different channel CHANNEL_BASE (default is 22). The base station collects this information and display it in the GUI.
A fourth node (sensys_jammer) will act as an interferer on the channel CHANNEL_SENDER. At a certain point, depending on the distance and the transmission power (that can be controlled using the Tmote Sky user button) the communication between the communicating pair will be broken. 
A fifth node (sensys_scanner) can optionally scan the 2.4 GHz frequencies and display the ongoing noise (pretty much as a spectrum analyzer).


How to run: 
Check and eventually change the node IDs of the motes involved in the communication, and upload the programs. 
How to display the user interface:
1. With an unified GUI. 
  - Install the rxtxserial librarier from http://www.rxtx.org/ and run the GUI.java (Java GUI folder)
2. Display the GUIs separately for each mote
  - make viewrssi for sensys_scanner
  - make viewinterferer for sensys_jammer
  - make viewbase for sensys_base
